FolderSearch is a program that has the following functions:

1. to_string: Used as a conversion function taking a wstring and converting it to string.
2. getFileExt: Used as a way of getting a file's extension, later learned about the .extension() function
so it is no longer used.
3. ExtCompare: Comparing the extension of a given file path with a list of acceptable extensions.
4. StringCompare: Comparing a line with a search phrase.
5. SearchFile: the main function of the program, it does the Folder Search.

Flow: 
>Getting the parameters, calling SearchFile Function using those parameters. 
>Checking if the path exists and is a directory.
>Using the filesystem recursive_directory_iterator to check all the folders and subfolders(if it was not
 allowed, I would have called SearchFile function when I found a new directory with the updated path as
 the only changing parameter)
>Checking file extension using ExtCompare , opening output file and checking if the file containts the
 search phrase using StringCompare function, line by line.

Problems encountered:
1. The task itself was something new for me, I had to learn in such a short amount of time to do all of this(Win API).
2. Wstring to string conversion, spent some time trying to understand what had to be done.
3. First time trying to implement multithreading, did not succeed.
